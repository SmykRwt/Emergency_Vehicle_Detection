# 🚦 Smart Traffic Management System

An AI-powered system to detect vehicles and manage traffic signals dynamically using **YOLOv8, OpenCV, and Pandas**.  
The goal is to reduce congestion and prioritize emergency vehicles in real-time.

---

## ✨ Features
- Vehicle detection using **YOLOv8** (cars, bikes, buses, trucks, ambulances, etc.)
- Real-time **video stream processing** with OpenCV
- Dynamic traffic signal adjustment based on congestion levels
- Emergency vehicle detection for priority clearance
- Data analysis with Pandas for traffic statistics
