# üö¶ Smart Traffic Management System

An AI-powered system to detect vehicles and manage traffic signals dynamically using **YOLOv8, OpenCV, and Pandas**.  
The goal is to reduce congestion and prioritize emergency vehicles in real-time.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Vehicle detection using **YOLOv8** (cars, bikes, buses, trucks, ambulances, etc.)
- Real-time **video stream processing** with OpenCV
- Dynamic traffic signal adjustment based on congestion levels
- Emergency vehicle detection for priority clearance
- Data analysis with Pandas for traffic statistics

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- Pandas, NumPy
- (Optional) Streamlit/Gradio for live demo UI
